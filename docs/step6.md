# Step 6: Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

This document outlines the implementation of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for our authentication system.

## MFA Functionality

### Endpoints

- Implemented MFA endpoints in `app/api/endpoints/auth.py`:
  - `POST /mfa/enable`: Initiates the MFA setup process
  - `POST /mfa/verify`: Verifies the MFA code and enables MFA
  - `POST /mfa/disable`: Disables MFA for a user

### Schemas

- Created MFA-related Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas/mfa.py`:
  - `MFAVerify`: For verifying MFA codes
  - `MFADisable`: For disabling MFA (requires password)
  - `MFAResponse`: For MFA operation responses

### Email Service

- Enhanced email service in `app/services/email.py`:
  - Implemented `send_mfa_code_email` function
  - Created responsive HTML email template for MFA codes
  - Added support for both development and production environments

### Security Features

- Implemented MFA code generation in `app/core/security.py`:
  - 6-digit numeric codes for better user experience
  - Short expiration time (10 minutes) for security
  - Single-use codes to prevent replay attacks

### User Model Integration

- Leveraged the existing `mfa_enabled` field in the User model
- Added user status check in authentication flow
- Used the `enable_mfa` method in the user CRUD module

### Token Management

- Used the existing token system for MFA:
  - Created `MFA` token type
  - Set 10-minute expiration for MFA tokens
  - Single-use tokens that are marked as used after verification

### Security Considerations

- Implemented various security features:
  - Short-lived tokens (10 minutes)
  - Single-use verification codes
  - Password verification required to disable MFA
  - Email-based MFA for reliable delivery

### Testing

- Implemented comprehensive integration tests in `app/tests/integration/test_mfa.py`:
  - Tests for enabling MFA
  - Tests for verifying MFA with valid and invalid codes
  - Tests for disabling MFA with correct and incorrect passwords

## Future Enhancements

- Implement alternative MFA methods (SMS, authenticator apps)
- Add QR code support for authenticator apps
- Implement backup codes for account recovery
- Add notification emails for MFA status changes
- Implement MFA bypass for trusted devices
