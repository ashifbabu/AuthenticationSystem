# Step 4: Account Deletion

This document outlines the implementation of the account deletion feature for our authentication system.

## Account Deletion Functionality

### Endpoints

- Implemented account deletion endpoint in `app/api/endpoints/users.py`:
  - `DELETE /me`: Allows a user to delete their account
  - Requires password confirmation for security
  - Performs a complete deletion of the user and all associated data

### CRUD Operations

- Enhanced CRUD operations to support account deletion:
  - Added `delete` method in `app/crud/user.py` to remove a user
  - Added `delete_all_user_tokens` method in `app/crud/token.py` to clean up all user tokens
  - Used existing OAuth account deletion methods from `app/crud/oauth_account.py`

### Security Considerations

- Password confirmation required to delete an account
  - Prevents unauthorized deletion if a session is hijacked
  - Exempts users who only have OAuth accounts (since they have no password)
- Complete data cleanup to ensure no orphaned records
  - Tokens (access, refresh, verification)
  - OAuth accounts
  - User record

### Testing

- Implemented integration tests in `app/tests/integration/test_users.py`:
  - Test for successful account deletion with correct password
  - Test for failed deletion attempt with incorrect password
  - Verification of complete data cleanup after deletion

## Privacy and Compliance Benefits

The account deletion feature is an essential part of privacy compliance frameworks such as:

1. **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
   - Implements the "right to erasure" requirement
   - Allows users to exercise their right to be forgotten

2. **CCPA** (California Consumer Privacy Act)
   - Supports the consumer right to delete personal information

3. **Other Privacy Regulations**
   - Provides a foundation for compliance with emerging privacy laws

## Next Steps

- Implement a soft-delete option to allow for account recovery
- Add administrative account management features
- Enhance audit logging for security events
- Add additional OAuth providers (GitHub, Twitter, etc.)
- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with alternative methods
