# Step 8: Security Notifications

This document outlines the implementation of security notifications for important account-related events in our authentication system.

## Security Notifications Functionality

### Email Service

- Enhanced email service in `app/services/email.py`:
  - Implemented `send_security_notification_email` function with support for various security events
  - Created responsive HTML email template for security notifications
  - Added contextual information about events in notifications

### Notification Types

- Implemented notifications for various security events:
  - `login_attempt`: Unusual login attempts or login from new device/location
  - `password_change`: Password changes via change password or reset password
  - `mfa_enabled`: When Multi-Factor Authentication is enabled
  - `mfa_disabled`: When Multi-Factor Authentication is disabled
  - `account_locked`: When an account is locked due to too many failed login attempts

### Endpoint Enhancements

- Added security notifications to key security endpoints:
  - `POST /login`: Sends notifications for suspicious login attempts, new device logins, and account lockouts
  - `PUT /change-password`: Notifies users when their password is changed
  - `POST /reset-password`: Notifies users when their password is reset
  - `POST /mfa/verify`: Notifies users when MFA is enabled
  - `POST /mfa/disable`: Notifies users when MFA is disabled

### Security Context

- Added rich security context in notifications:
  - IP address of the request
  - User agent (browser/device information)
  - Timestamp of the event
  - Event-specific details (e.g., attempts remaining before lockout)
  - Action instructions based on event type

### Implementation Details

- Used FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to send emails asynchronously
- Implemented adaptive notification content based on event type
- Added clear action instructions for users based on security event
- Included direct instructions for securing accounts if suspicious activity

## Security Benefits

1. **Improved User Awareness**
   - Users are immediately informed of security-relevant changes to their account
   - Notifications provide early warning of potential unauthorized access

2. **Fraud Prevention**
   - Quick detection of unauthorized access attempts
   - Immediate notification of password changes
   - Alerts about new device logins

3. **Security Transparency**
   - Users have visibility into account security events
   - Clear audit trail of account-related activities

## User Experience Considerations

- **Notification Clarity**: Clear explanations of what happened and what action to take
- **Actionable Information**: Every notification includes specific action steps
- **Contextual Security Information**: Details of the device, location, and time of event
- **Responsive Email Design**: Mobile-friendly email templates for easy reading on any device

## Next Steps

- Implement IP geolocation to provide more accurate location information
- Add user preferences for notification types (allow opting out of certain notifications)
- Implement in-app notifications alongside email notifications
- Create a security event log that users can review
- Add risk scoring for more intelligent notification triggering
