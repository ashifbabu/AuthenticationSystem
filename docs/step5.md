# Step 5: Password Management

This document outlines the implementation of password management features for our authentication system.

## Password Management Functionality

### Endpoints

- Implemented password management endpoints in `app/api/endpoints/auth.py`:
  - `POST /forgot-password`: Initiates the password reset process
  - `POST /reset-password`: Completes the password reset with a valid token
  - `PUT /change-password`: Changes password for authenticated users

### Schemas

- Created password-related Pydantic schemas in `app/schemas/password.py`:
  - `PasswordResetRequest`: For initiating password reset (email)
  - `PasswordReset`: For completing password reset (token, new_password)
  - `ChangePassword`: For changing password (current_password, new_password)
  - Implemented strong password validation via validators

### Email Service

- Enhanced email service in `app/services/email.py`:
  - Implemented `send_password_reset_email` function
  - Created responsive HTML email template
  - Added support for both development (console output) and production (Amazon SES) environments

### Token Management

- Used the existing token system for password reset:
  - Created `PASSWORD_RESET` token type
  - Set 24-hour expiration for reset tokens
  - Single-use tokens that are marked as used after successful reset

### Security Considerations

- Implemented various security features:
  - Always return 204 for forgot-password even if email doesn't exist (prevents enumeration)
  - Strong password requirements with validators
  - Require current password verification for changing password
  - Limited token lifetime
  - Single-use reset tokens

### Testing

- Implemented comprehensive integration tests in `app/tests/integration/test_password.py`:
  - Tests for forgot-password with existing and non-existing emails
  - Tests for reset-password with valid and invalid tokens
  - Tests for password format validation
  - Tests for change-password with correct and incorrect current passwords

## Next Steps

- Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Add password history to prevent reuse of old passwords
- Add account lockout after multiple failed password attempts
- Implement session management for login from multiple devices
- Add notification emails for password changes
