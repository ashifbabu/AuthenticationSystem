# Step 7: Account Lockout

This document outlines the implementation of account lockout features for enhancing security against brute force attacks in our authentication system.

## Account Lockout Functionality

### Models

- Created a `LoginAttempt` model in `app/models/login_attempt.py`:
  - Tracks login attempt details including email, IP address, user agent, success/failure status, and timestamp
  - Provides helper methods to check for account lockout status

### CRUD Operations

- Implemented CRUD operations for login attempts in `app/crud/login_attempt.py`:
  - `create`: Records a login attempt
  - `get_recent_attempts`: Retrieves recent login attempts
  - `count_recent_failed_attempts`: Counts recent failed login attempts
  - `is_account_locked`: Checks if an account is locked
  - `cleanup_old_attempts`: Removes old login attempt records

### Endpoints

- Enhanced login endpoint in `app/api/endpoints/auth.py`:
  - Checks account lockout status before authentication
  - Records login attempts (both successful and failed)
  - Provides feedback on remaining attempts before lockout
  - Returns appropriate error messages when account is locked

- Added account management endpoints:
  - `GET /account-status/{email}`: Checks account lockout status
  - `POST /unlock-account/{email}`: Administrative endpoint to unlock an account

### Configuration

- Added configuration settings in `app/core/config.py`:
  - `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`: Maximum number of failed login attempts before lockout (default: 5)
  - `ACCOUNT_LOCKOUT_MINUTES`: Duration of account lockout in minutes (default: 30)

### Security Features

- Implemented progressive security:
  - Warning messages with attempt count on failed logins
  - Temporary account lockout after exceeding maximum attempts
  - IP address tracking for additional security context
  - Administrative controls to manually unlock accounts

### Testing

- Implemented comprehensive integration tests in `app/tests/integration/test_account_lockout.py`:
  - Tests for tracking login attempts
  - Tests for account lockout after maximum failed attempts
  - Tests for login prevention when account is locked
  - Tests for administrative account unlocking
  - Tests for checking account status

## Security Benefits

1. **Brute Force Protection**
   - Prevents attackers from trying many password combinations
   - Makes password guessing attacks impractical

2. **Account Security**
   - Protects user accounts from unauthorized access attempts
   - Notifies users of suspicious login activity through attempt tracking

3. **Administrative Controls**
   - Provides administrators with tools to assist users
   - Offers visibility into account security status

## Next Steps

- Implement IP-based rate limiting for enhanced security
- Add notification emails for suspicious login activity
- Implement progressive lockouts (longer lockout periods for repeated violations)
- Add CAPTCHA challenges after a certain number of failed attempts
- Implement more granular logging for security auditing purposes
